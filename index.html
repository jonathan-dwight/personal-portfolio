										<h3>JD Buendia, Full Stack Software Engineer</h3>
										<p>Ever since I was a kid, I’ve always had the idea of wanting to build something. I grew up playing with Legos, and I always
										enjoyed the creative aspect to build whatever I wanted with different pieces. Fast forward to now, I am a technical recruiter turned
										Software Engineer. I knew nothing about tech before but throughout my career as a recruiter, my interest in tech grew as I was learning what type of work and
										projects successful professionals were doing in the industry.</p>
										<p>Somethings I enjoy doing outside of coding are snowboarding with friends, eating food, playing Call of Duty Warzone, and attending music festivals. I am a very big snowboarding fan, so every year I always wait for the season to come, which can sometimes feel like forever! 
											If you look at my projects below, my love for food, especially burgers, explains itself.
											Feel free to connect with me and download my resume below! I am open to positions in both Los Angeles and San Francisco, but
											you can also connect with me if you want to just chat about snowboarding, food, and music festivals. I always enjoy those topics!

									<h3>Technologies/Skill Set</h3>
									<p>With tech always changing so rapidly, I am always excited to continue to learn something new. Even though my journey has
									just begun, my technology toolkit right now includes:</p>
									<p>
										React, Redux,
										JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, SQL, Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, HTML5, and CSS.
									</p>
									<p>I am a recent graduate from App Academy. My first project was FlavorCheck, a clone of Untappd, which was built with Ruby
									on Rails in the backend and React/Redux in the front-end. This was a solo project built within a 2 weeks time-frame. My second project was a
									group project called Slaw, which builds an active-lifestyle community for individuals who do not want to workout and do
									physical activities alone and connect with others who feel the same. This was built an entirely new stack, the MERN
									Stack, which we had to all learn within one weekend. I spearheaded most of our daily meetings and implemented the
									features that required a lot of outside research, such as the AWS S3 incorporation for image upload and hosting, and
									Socket.io for real-time chat. I also assisted with providing solutions or feedback on how the main CRUD features should
									be built out. My last project was a game called Over Grilled. This game test your abilities to create as many burgers to match the orders.
									This game was built solely with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3.</p>
